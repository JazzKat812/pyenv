Package release guidelines
==========================

The release of the new version of pyenv is done via GitHub releases.
Minor version is pushed if there are significant functional changes (not e.g. bugfixes/formula adaptations/supporting niche use cases). Major version is pushed if there are breaking changes.

Release checklist:
- Start [drafting a new release on GitHub](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/releases) to generate a summary of changes
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version number and autogenerated summary (only the changes section)
- Change the version number in `libexec/pyenv---version`
- Create and push a new tag with the new version number (also can be done via GitHub Releases UI), like `v2.3.5`
- Create a new release on GitHub
